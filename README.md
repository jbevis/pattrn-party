## Pattrn Party

Basic stylesheet demonstrating three different CSS features. Accordion tabs, flexible cards, and a header search bar.

#### Accordion Tabs

- This feature allows for displaying and hiding different tabs of content. On full desktop this feature has tabs the stretch across the DOM, and function similar to how filing tabs would workn in a filing cabinet. On the mobile view this switch to a vertical layout which drop down on a button click, and collapse on another.

#### Flexible cards

- This feature defines a set grid area and that cards can be laid out in an organized way. Flexbox then allows for the cards to maintain their position within the grid as the window size is adjusted. At small enough screen size, the cards switch to a column each taking up the full width of the container.

#### Menu Bar

- This feature is a menu bar featuring what would be navigation links and a search bar. On a desktop view, the bar has a row layout and displays all links and the search input area. On mobile the links and input collapse into the menu bar, and can be viewed on a click of the menu bar element.
